   -Logical operators (&&, ||, !).
   -Ternary operator.
4. Control Structures
   -Conditional statements (if, else, elseif, switch).
   -Loops (for, while, do-while, foreach).
   -Breaking out of loops with break and continue.
5. Functions in PHP
   -Defining and calling functions.
   -Function parameters, default values, and return values.
   -Variable scope (global vs local).
   -Anonymous functions and closures.
6. Working with Arrays
   -Indexed, associative, and multidimensional arrays.
   -Array functions (array_push, array_pop, array_merge, in_array, array_keys, etc.).
   -Iterating over arrays.
7. String Manipulation
   -String functions (strlen, str_replace, strtoupper, strtolower, substr, etc.).
   -String concatenation and interpolation.
   -Working with regular expressions.
8. File Handling
   -Reading and writing files (fopen, fwrite, fread, fclose).
   -Checking file existence and properties.
   -Working with file permissions.
9. Form Handling and Data Validation
   -Processing form input with PHP.
   -Validating user input.
   -Preventing SQL injection and securing form data.
10. Sessions and Cookies
    -Introduction to sessions and cookies.
    -Setting, retrieving, and destroying session data.
    -Setting and retrieving cookies.
11. Database Interaction (MySQL)
    -Introduction to connecting PHP with MySQL.

    -Prepared statements for secure SQL.
12. Object-Oriented Programming in PHP
    -Classes, objects, properties, and methods.
    -Access modifiers (public, protected, private).
    -Inheritance and polymorphism.
    -Magic methods (**construct, **destruct, **get, **set, etc.).
    -Interfaces and traits.
13. Error Handling
    -Basic error handling with try, catch, and finally.
    -Custom error handling with set_error_handler.
    -Logging errors to files.
14. Working with APIs
    -Introduction to REST APIs and making HTTP requests.
    -Using curl and file_get_contents to interact with APIs.
    -Parsing JSON responses.
15. Common Algorithms in PHP
    -Sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort).
    -Searching algorithms (e.g., binary search).
    -Basic data structures (e.g., stacks, queues).
    -Recursion (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci sequence).
    -String algorithms (e.g., reverse string, palindrome check).
16. Advanced Topics
    -PHP 8 features (null-safe operator, named arguments, match expressions).
    -Namespaces and autoloading.
    -Dependency management with Composer.
17. Building a Simple Project
    Bringing it all together with a small PHP project.
